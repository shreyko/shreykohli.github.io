This is my attempt at creating the first iteration of my personal portfolio.
It is not responsive ,i.e. it will work as desired with select devices and screen resolutions.
I have tried to make it interactive with parallax effects, reaction to mouse input, scroll/hover animations.
I am working on a second iteration as you read this using React JS and spline to offer responsiveness and 3D animations.
Hopefully the next iteration will solve all the issues with this one.
Expected rollout of portfolio2.0 is SEP 2022
